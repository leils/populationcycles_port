 Endangered Sea Otters
California sea otters are part of a community somewhat like the one in this exhibit, though more complex. The otters eat sea urchins, and the sea urchins eat kelp (seaweed). 
In the 1800’s, fur hunters killed off nearly all of California’s sea otters. So urchin numbers skyrocketed, and they ate almost all the kelp. 
Once hunting was banned, the otters made a comeback, and so did the kelp. But otters haven’t recovered as strongly or quickly as scientists predicted, so there must be other factors affecting otter survival.
